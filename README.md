# myChat-v0.1
This Chat application to communicate between Java PC and Android (many to many)
The server-side in executable files is a local host which use Wampserver and a Mongo Database that run on port 27017
Any change in server-side will required to change this in source code and the executable file will not work fine
there is a readme text file behind each folder to make sure that the server-side works good as possible
